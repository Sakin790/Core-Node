The cluster module in Node.js is useful in scenarios where you need to take 
advantage of multi-core systems to improve the performance and reliability 
of your application. Here are some situations where you might want to use 
the cluster module:

High-Traffic Web Servers:

When your Node.js application handles a high
volume of incoming requests, using the cluster
module can help balance the load across multiple 
processes. This ensures that no single process becomes a bottleneck.

CPU-Intensive Tasks:
If your application performs CPU-intensive operations 
(e.g., complex calculations, data processing), 
distributing these tasks across multiple worker processes can prevent the main event loop from being blocked, leading to smoother performance.
Improving Reliability:

By using the cluster module, you can enhance the reliability of your application. If a worker process crashes, the master process can automatically fork a new worker to replace it, minimizing downtime.
Scalability:

The cluster module allows your Node.js application to scale horizontally across multiple CPU cores. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle increased load or traffic over time.
Resource Utilization:

Running multiple worker processes can help fully utilize the available system resources (CPU cores), leading to better overall performance and efficiency.
Example Use Case:
Imagine you have a web application that needs to handle thousands of requests per second. Using a single-threaded Node.js process might not be sufficient to handle this load efficiently. By using the cluster module, you can distribute the incoming requests across multiple worker processes, each running on a separate CPU core. This setup can help ensure that your application remains responsive and can handle the high traffic.
